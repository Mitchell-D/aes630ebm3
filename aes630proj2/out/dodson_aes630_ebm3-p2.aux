\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3}{\ignorespaces Equilibrium temperatures of each layer given increasing layer 1 longwave absorption, and decreasing transmission. The average linear rates of change (calculated with forward-differencing) are $-156.941\,\si {K}$, $28.881\,\si {K}$, and $24.270\,\si {K}$, respectively, however the layer 1 curve (and magnitude) makes it clear that the relationship is not linear. The rapid decrease in layer 1 temperature with additional thermal absorption is counterintuitive. Since longwave emissions incident on layer 1 only come from below, the additional absorption must cause the total amount of energy retained in the atmosphere to increase. This is because additional top-layer absorption can only decrease the amount of longwave radiation escaping to space from below. Shortwave interactions are unchanged, so the equilibrium emission temperature of Earth must be the same. Thus, as above, since the modified layer 1 contributes more to the emission temperature with greater absorption, the layer's equilibrium temperature should decrease substantially to offset the additional energy from below.}}{3}{}\protected@file@percent }
